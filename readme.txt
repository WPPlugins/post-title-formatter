Hello!

Thanks for downloading plugin Post Title Content Formatter. As a simple, but useful plugin for the writers and content providers, 
its functions are the following: 

1. Remove the full stop from the end of the post title. 

2. Capitalise first letter of the title. 

3. Add space after the comma.

With this plugin you won't have to make these awful post revisions and finally be more confident about your content managers. 


Thanks again for the download!
